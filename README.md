# hello-world
Created during Learning GitHub

My name is Rachel Bock.  I am interested in becoming a Web Developer when I grow up.  I want to code games and activities that help build character rather than just for entertainment.  I also want to create learning games that help others to become better at the soft skills that are so vital in "surviving the rat race."
